## Waste Breakdown by Category

### Root Causes

```
[Create bar chart or table showing:]

Vague Requirements:        [XX]% ($[AMOUNT])
Missing File Paths:        [XX]% ($[AMOUNT])
Unclear Scope:             [XX]% ($[AMOUNT])
Midstream Changes:         [XX]% ($[AMOUNT])
Other:                     [XX]% ($[AMOUNT])
```

**Analysis:** [Explain which root cause is most problematic and why]

### Violated Patterns

```
[Most commonly violated interaction patterns:]

Complete Requirements Upfront:  [XX] violations
Exact File Paths:               [XX] violations
Batch Questions:                [XX] violations
```

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Monthly Cost Trend

| Month | Total Cost | Wasted Cost | Efficiency |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------|
| [M-2] | $[XX] | $[XX] | [XX]% |
| [M-1] | $[XX] | $[XX] | [XX]% |
| [Current] | $[XX] | $[XX] | [XX]% |

**Trend:** [Improving/Declining/Stable]

### Projected Annual Waste

```
Current monthly waste: $[XX]
Projected annual:      $[XX * 12]

If efficiency improved to 80%:
Monthly savings:       $[AMOUNT]
Annual savings:        $[AMOUNT * 12]
```

**ROI of Training Program:** If we invest $[TRAINING_COST] in training and improve efficiency by 20%, we save $[ANNUAL_SAVINGS] per year.

## Appendix

### How to Read This Report

**Efficiency Score:**
- **80-100%:** Optimal - requirements were clear, execution was efficient
- **60-79%:** Acceptable - minor inefficiencies, room for improvement
- **40-59%:** Inefficient - significant token waste, training needed
- **0-39%:** Severely Wasteful - major issues, immediate action required

**Human Quality Score:**
- Measures clarity and completeness of initial requirements (0-100)
- Based on AI agent's assessment of how well requirements were specified

**Waste Calculation:**
- Waste Tokens = Tokens Used - Tokens Optimal
- Optimal Tokens = Estimated tokens if requirements were clear and execution was single-pass

# AI Agent Governance Framework

A comprehensive framework for deploying, governing, and managing AI agents as autonomous team members using the **Problem → Action → Results (PAR)** model.

## 🎯 Overview

This framework enables organizations to:
- Deploy AI agents with clear governance and accountability
- Manage costs and ROI across agent tiers
- Maintain security, compliance, and audit trails
- Scale AI operations with human oversight

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Your First Agent

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JohnYoungSuh/ai-agent-governance-framework.git
cd ai-agent-governance-framework

# Set up a new agent
./scripts/setup-agent.sh --tier 1 --name "doc-analyzer"

# Review the generated configuration
cat agents/doc-analyzer/config.yml
```

### 2. Run a PAR Cycle

```bash
# Initialize agent session
./scripts/par-session.sh --agent doc-analyzer --problem "Analyze Q3 reports"

# The script will guide you through:
# - Problem definition
# - Action planning & approval
# - Execution monitoring
# - Results validation
```

### 3. Track Costs

```bash
# Generate monthly cost report
./scripts/cost-report.sh --month 2025-10

# Check agent performance
./scripts/agent-scorecard.sh --agent doc-analyzer
```

## 📋 Agent Tier Overview

| Tier | Role | Autonomy | Use Cases | Avg Cost/Task |
|------|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Observer | Read-only | Docs, analysis, Q&A | $0.10-$0.50 |
| 2 | Developer | Dev env only | Coding, testing, refactoring | $0.50-$5.00 |
| 3 | Operations | Production (approved) | Deployments, runbooks | $1.00-$10.00 |
| 4 | Architect | Design & research | System design, POCs | $5.00-$50.00 |

## 🔒 Governance Principles

1. **Human Primacy** - Humans always have final authority
2. **Transparency** - All agent actions are auditable
3. **Accountability** - Clear ownership and responsibility
4. **Safety** - Risk-based controls and approvals
5. **Cost Efficiency** - ROI tracking and optimization

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Overall ROI Target**: >5:1 (time/cost saved vs. spent)
- **Policy Compliance**: <1% violation rate
- **Agent Quality**: <5% defect rate on completed tasks
- **Human Time Saved**: >70% reallocated to strategic work

## New Feature: Tit-for-Tat Game Theory Model

### What Was Added

**Tit-for-Tat Reputation System** for continuous improvement based on Robert Axelrod's research (1984):

#### Documentation Updates
- **docs/COOPERATIVE-GAME-THEORY.md**:
  - Added Section 4: "Tit-for-Tat Strategy for Continuous Improvement"
  - Explains how agents build reputation through cooperation
  - Shows forgiveness mechanism for occasional failures
  - Added Axelrod references to bibliography
  - Updated version to 2.1 (2025-10-19)

#### Code Implementation
- **scripts/game_theory/cooperative_improvement_validator.py**:
  - Added `AgentReputation` class with tit-for-tat logic
  - Implements cooperation score tracking (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Dynamic approval thresholds based on reputation
  - Forgiveness mechanism for learning from mistakes
  - Records proposal history and outcomes

#### Test Suite
- **scripts/game_theory/test_tit_for_tat.py** (NEW):
  - Demonstrates 6-round scenario
  - Shows cooperation → defection → forgiveness cycle
  - Validates tit-for-tat incentive structure
  - Executable test with clear output

### How It Works

```python
# Agent with high cooperation score (0.9+)
→ Approval threshold: 0.6 (easier approval, faster iteration)

# Agent with medium cooperation (0.7-0.9)
→ Approval threshold: 0.75 (normal review)

# Agent with low cooperation (<0.5)
→ Approval threshold: 0.95 (strict review, rebuild trust)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Incentivizes consistent high-quality proposals
- ✅ Forgives occasional errors (agents learn)
- ✅ Penalizes persistent gaming/exaggeration
- ✅ Self-enforcing through reputation dynamics
- ✅ No complex contracts needed

### Usage Example

```bash
# Run tit-for-tat test
python3 scripts/game_theory/test_tit_for_tat.py

# Use in validator
from cooperative_improvement_validator import CooperativeImprovementValidator

validator = CooperativeImprovementValidator()
validator.record_proposal_outcome(proposal, actual_metrics, was_approved)

# Reputation automatically updates with tit-for-tat logic
reputation = validator.get_agent_reputation(agent_id)
print(f"Cooperation: {reputation.cooperation_score}")
print(f"Threshold: {reputation.get_approval_threshold()}")
```

## Summary

The repository has been prepared for Suhlabs internal use by:
1. Renaming references from public to internal repository (suhlabs/ai-agent-governance-framework-internal)
2. Updating all contact information to Suhlabs (governance-team@suhlabs.com)
3. Updating git remote to point to Suhlabs repository
4. **Adding tit-for-tat game theory model** for continuous improvement
5. Maintaining all technical functionality and features

All governance framework features, compliance mappings, and technical implementations remain intact and ready for internal deployment. The new tit-for-tat model enhances the framework's ability to incentivize AI agents toward consistent, high-quality improvement proposals.

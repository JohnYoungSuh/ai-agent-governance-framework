## How to Achieve ATO (Authority to Operate)

### Step 1: Complete SSP Package ✅

- [x] System description (security categorization, architecture)
- [x] Control implementation statements (298/339 implemented)
- [x] Control summary table
- [x] POA&M for gaps
- [x] Policies and procedures
- [ ] System diagrams (TODO - see `ssp/diagrams/`)
- [ ] Privacy Impact Assessment (TODO - if PII processed)

### Step 2: Address Critical POA&M Items 🔄

**High Priority Items** (must complete before ATO):
- [ ] POA&M #1: Vector store ACLs (Target: 2026-01-31)
- [ ] POA&M #3: Change management automation (Target: 2026-02-15)
- [ ] POA&M #9: Annual security assessment (Target: 2026-03-31)
- [ ] POA&M #10: Penetration testing (Target: 2026-06-30)

**All others**: Medium priority, acceptable with compensating controls

### Step 3: Engage 3PAO 📅

- [ ] Issue RFP for Third-Party Assessment Organization (Target: 2026-01-15)
- [ ] Conduct security assessment (Target: 2026-03-01 - 2026-03-15)
- [ ] Remediate findings
- [ ] Receive Security Assessment Report (SAR)

### Step 4: Submit Authorization Package 📄

Package contents:
- [x] System Security Plan (SSP) - This directory
- [ ] Security Assessment Report (SAR) - From 3PAO
- [x] Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)
- [ ] Contingency Plan (CP)
- [ ] Incident Response Plan (IR)
- [ ] Configuration Management Plan (CM)
- [ ] Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) - if applicable

Submit to: Authorizing Official (AO)

### Step 5: Receive ATO Decision

**Expected Timeline**: Q2 2026 (April - June 2026)

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Full ATO**: 3-year authorization
2. **Conditional ATO**: 6-month authorization with conditions
3. **Denial**: Address findings and resubmit

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is the system ready for ATO?

**A**: Yes. 88% of controls are fully implemented, with compensating controls for all gaps. The 11 POA&M items are acceptable risks per NIST guidelines, and all have funded remediation plans.

### Q: What about the 12% of controls that aren't fully implemented?

**A**: These are documented in the POA&M with:
- Detailed remediation plans and timelines
- Compensating controls that reduce risk to acceptable levels
- Funding and resources allocated
- Regular progress tracking (monthly reviews)

### Q: Do I need FedRAMP or can I use this for other frameworks?

**A**: This SSP is designed for FedRAMP but also covers:
- FISMA (federal systems)
- SOC 2 Type II (commercial SaaS)
- ISO 27001 (international)
- Industry-specific: PCI-DSS, HIPAA (if applicable)

Use `policies/control-mappings.md` to map to your specific framework.

### Q: How much does ATO cost?

**A**: Estimated costs:
- **3PAO Assessment**: $50,000 - $75,000 (one-time)
- **Penetration Test**: $25,000 - $35,000 (annual)
- **Internal Effort**: ~400 hours (evidence prep + remediation)
- **Ongoing Compliance**: ~40 hours/month (continuous monitoring)

### Q: How long does the ATO process take?

**A**: Typical timeline:
- **Months 1-2**: Complete SSP and address critical POA&M items (done)
- **Month 3**: 3PAO engagement and preparation
- **Month 4**: Security assessment (2 weeks) + remediation (2 weeks)
- **Month 5**: Submit authorization package
- **Month 6**: AO review and decision

**Total**: ~6 months from SSP completion to ATO

### Q: Can I get a conditional ATO faster?

**A**: Possibly. If your AO accepts:
- Current 88% implementation rate
- Documented compensating controls
- Committed POA&M timelines

You may receive a **6-month conditional ATO** while completing remaining items.

### Q: What happens if I don't maintain compliance?

**A**: Consequences:
- **Minor gaps**: Update POA&M, maintain ATO
- **Significant gaps**: Conditional ATO or suspension
- **Critical violations**: ATO revocation

**Mitigation**: Use continuous monitoring dashboards to catch issues early.

# Leadership Approval Workflow for Project Creation

## Overview
This document describes the **leadership approval and revenue alignment system** that ensures all AI-driven projects support strategic business goals and generate measurable value.

## Philosophy
**Every project must justify its existence through strategic alignment and financial impact.**

Leadership needs to know:
1. **Which strategic goal** does this project support?
2. **What revenue impact** will it have?
3. **What's the ROI** compared to cost?
4. **Is this aligned** with company OKRs?

## Approval Workflow

### Step 1: Project Creation Request
When someone creates a project using `create-governed-project.sh`, they must provide:

**Business Alignment (Required)**
- Strategic goal selection (9 options)
- Detailed explanation of alignment
- Revenue impact type
- Estimated annual financial value
- Confidence level
- Revenue calculation explanation
- Priority level

**Resource Requirements (Required)**
- Monthly AI agent budget
- Estimated total project cost
- Human resource allocation

### Step 2: Automatic Approval Tier Determination

The system automatically determines required approval tier based on:

| Budget/Month | Approval Tier | Decision Maker |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| < $500 | Team Lead Only | Proceeds immediately |
| $500 - $2K | Manager Approval | Engineering/Product Manager |
| $2K - $10K | Director Approval | Director of Engineering |
| $10K - $50K | VP Approval | VP of Engineering/Product |
| > $50K | Executive Approval | C-Level Executive |

**Strategic Initiative Override:**
- "Enter New Market" ‚Üí Executive Approval (regardless of budget)
- "Product Innovation" ‚Üí Executive Approval (regardless of budget)

### Step 3: Leadership Review in Jira

If approval is required (budget >= $500 or strategic initiative):

1. **Approval request JSON is generated**
   - Location: `~/projects/project-approval-requests/PCR-YYYY-NNNN.json`
   - Contains complete project details, business case, ROI

2. **Jira issue is created** (via `submit-project-approval.py`)
   - Project: PROJAPPR (Project Approvals)
   - Rich formatted description with:
     - Project overview
     - Business alignment and strategic goal
     - Revenue impact analysis
     - Financial analysis (ROI, payback period)
     - Resource requirements
     - Risk assessment
     - Required approvers

3. **Slack notification sent** (optional)
   - Posted to leadership channel
   - Includes key metrics and Jira link
   - Action button to review

4. **Leadership reviews and decides**
   - Approve ‚Üí Project can be created
   - Reject ‚Üí Project blocked with reason
   - Request More Info ‚Üí Requester provides additional details

### Step 4: Project Creation
Once approved:
- Requester runs `create-governed-project.sh` again
- For budgets < $500, proceeds immediately
- For budgets >= $500, must provide approved Jira issue key

## Revenue Impact Types

Leadership sees one of these revenue impact types:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Direct Revenue Generation** | Project directly generates new revenue | Sales automation bot, lead generation |
| **Revenue Enablement** | Enables sales/growth teams | CRM integration, proposal generator |
| **Cost Reduction (OpEx)** | Reduces operating expenses | Support automation, process efficiency |
| **Cost Reduction (CapEx)** | Reduces capital expenditures | Cloud optimization, infrastructure automation |
| **Cost Avoidance** | Prevents future costs | Compliance automation, security improvements |
| **Customer Retention** | Improves retention/reduces churn | Customer success bot, proactive support |
| **Efficiency Gain** | Increases team productivity | Development tools, automation |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Reduces business/technical risk | Security scanning, compliance monitoring |
| **None** | No direct financial impact | Exploratory projects, R&D |

## Strategic Goals Alignment

Every project must map to one of these company strategic goals:

1. **Increase Revenue** - New revenue streams, upsell/cross-sell
2. **Reduce Costs** - Operating efficiency, automation
3. **Improve Customer Experience** - Satisfaction, NPS, support quality
4. **Enter New Market** - Geographic, vertical, or product expansion
5. **Product Innovation** - New capabilities, competitive differentiation
6. **Operational Excellence** - Process improvement, quality
7. **Compliance & Risk Management** - Regulatory, security, audit
8. **Technical Debt Reduction** - Code quality, maintainability
9. **Team Productivity** - Developer/ops efficiency, tooling

## Financial Analysis (Auto-Calculated)

Leadership sees automatic ROI calculations:

```
Monthly AI Budget:        $2,000
Monthly Infrastructure:   $500
Total Monthly Cost:       $2,500
Annual Cost:             $30,000

Estimated Annual Value:  $150,000
ROI Ratio:               5.0:1
Payback Period:          2.4 months
Net Annual Impact:       +$120,000
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- ROI < 2:1 ‚Üí Requires strong justification
- ROI 2:1 to 5:1 ‚Üí Standard approval
- ROI > 5:1 ‚Üí Fast-track approval
- Payback < 6 months ‚Üí Positive signal
- Payback > 12 months ‚Üí Requires long-term strategic rationale

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Small Project (No Approval Required)

```bash
$ ./create-governed-project.sh

# User fills in:
Project Name: log-analyzer
Budget: $300/month
Strategic Goal: Team Productivity
Revenue Impact: Efficiency Gain, $10,000/year

# Result:
‚úÖ Approval Tier: Team Lead Only (<$500/mo)
‚úÖ Project created immediately (no approval gate)
```

### Example 2: Medium Project (Manager Approval)

```bash
$ ./create-governed-project.sh

# User fills in:
Project Name: customer-support-bot
Budget: $1,500/month
Strategic Goal: Reduce Costs
Revenue Impact: Cost Reduction (OpEx), $80,000/year

# Result:
‚ö† This project requires leadership approval
‚úÖ Approval request created: ~/projects/project-approval-requests/PCR-2025-0234.json

Next Steps:
1. Review request
2. Submit to Jira: python3 submit-project-approval.py --request-file PCR-2025-0234.json
3. Wait for manager approval
4. Re-run script with approved Jira issue
```

### Example 3: Strategic Initiative (Executive Approval)

```bash
$ ./create-governed-project.sh

# User fills in:
Project Name: ai-product-recommendations
Budget: $5,000/month
Strategic Goal: Product Innovation
Revenue Impact: Direct Revenue Generation, $500,000/year

# Result:
‚ö† This project requires leadership approval
‚úÖ Approval Tier: Executive Approval (Strategic Initiative)
‚úÖ Jira issue PROJAPPR-456 created
‚úÖ Slack notification sent to #leadership

Next Steps:
1. Executive reviews in Jira
2. Business case discussion
3. Approval or request for more info
4. Re-run script after approval
```

## Integration with Existing Governance

This approval workflow integrates with the existing agent tier system:

| Agent Tier | Existing Controls | New Approval Requirement |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Tier 1** (Observer) | Read-only, MI-001, MI-009 | Leadership approval if budget >= $500 |
| **Tier 2** (Developer) | Dev env, MI-001/009/021 | Leadership approval if budget >= $500 |
| **Tier 3** (Operations) | Production, threat model, Jira CR | Leadership approval if budget >= $500 + production CR |
| **Tier 4** (Architect) | Design, threat model, Jira CR | Leadership approval if budget >= $500 + architecture review |

**Key Point:** Budget-based approval is a **separate gate** from tier-based controls. Both must be satisfied.

## Slack Notifications

Optional Slack integration notifies leadership channel:

```
üöÄ New Project Approval Request: customer-support-bot

Requester: Jane Smith | Engineering
Strategic Goal: Reduce Costs | Priority: High
Monthly Budget: $1,500 | Est. Annual Value: $80,000
ROI: 5.3:1 | Agent Tier: 3

Revenue Impact: Cost Reduction (OpEx)
Automates tier-1 support inquiries, reducing support team load...

[Review in Jira] (button)
```

## Audit Trail

All approval requests include complete audit trail:

```json
{
  "audit_trail": {
    "created_at": "2025-10-23T14:30:00Z",
    "created_by": "jane.smith@example.com",

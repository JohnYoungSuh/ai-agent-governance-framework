**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Audience:** Human operators working with AI agents

---

## Purpose

This guide establishes clear expectations for human-AI collaboration, defines AI agent limitations, and provides interaction patterns that optimize efficiency and minimize frustration.

---

## Understanding Your Efficiency Score

At the end of significant AI agent sessions (>20,000 tokens), you'll receive an efficiency score. Here's what it means:

### Efficiency Categories Explained

| Category | Score Range | What It Means | Your Experience | Action Needed |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Optimal** | 80-100% | Requirements were clear, AI executed efficiently, minimal waste | "That went smoothly!" | None - keep doing what you're doing |
| **Acceptable** | 60-79% | Some inefficiency, but reasonable | "A few hiccups, but got there" | Optional: Review guidelines |
| **Inefficient** | 40-59% | Significant token waste, multiple issues | "Felt frustrating and slow" | Training recommended |
| **Severely Wasteful** | 0-39% | Major problems, very inefficient | "Lots of back-and-forth confusion" | Mandatory training required |

### Real Examples by Category

#### Optimal (80-100%) - What Success Looks Like

**Scenario:**
```
You: "Update /home/user/project/config.yml - change timeout from 10 to 30 seconds"
AI: [Reads file once, makes change, shows diff]
You: "Perfect, commit it"
AI: [Commits]
Done in 5,000 tokens.
```

**Why optimal:**
- Exact file path provided
- Specific change described
- Single-pass execution
- No clarification needed

**Your feedback:** "Efficiency: Optimal - clear requirements, single-pass execution"

---

#### Acceptable (60-79%) - Minor Issues

**Scenario:**
```
You: "Update the timeout config"
AI: "Which config file? There are 3 config files."
You: "config.yml"
AI: "Which timeout? I see connection_timeout and request_timeout"
You: "connection_timeout to 30"
AI: [Makes change]
Done in 8,000 tokens (optimal would be 5,000).
```

**Why acceptable:**
- Requirements initially vague but AI asked good questions
- You provided answers quickly
- Got to solution with minor overhead
- 60% efficient (5000/8000)

**Your feedback:** "Efficiency: Acceptable - needed 2 clarification rounds, next time specify file and parameter upfront"

---

#### Inefficient (40-59%) - Significant Problems

**Scenario:**
```
You: "Fix the config"
AI: "Which config?"
You: "The timeout one"
AI: "Which file?"
You: "I don't know, find it"
AI: [Searches 10 files, reads 5]
You: "No, not that one"
AI: [Tries another file]
You: "Maybe in the main config?"
AI: [Finally finds it]
Done in 15,000 tokens (optimal would be 5,000).
```

**Why inefficient:**
- Very vague initial request
- Multiple clarification rounds
- AI had to search/guess
- You didn't know exact file
- 33% efficient (5000/15000)

**Your feedback:** "Efficiency: Inefficient - vague requirements caused search overhead. Review token_optimization.md before next session."

**What to do:**
- Training strongly recommended
- Before next session: Learn to find file paths (`ls`, `find`, file explorer)
- Review "Provide Complete Requirements" section

---

#### Severely Wasteful (<40%) - Major Issues

**Scenario:**
```
You: "Do the thing"
AI: "What thing?"
You: "You know, the config thing"
AI: "Which config?"
[15 rounds of back-and-forth]
AI: [Tries wrong approach]
You: "No, wrong file"
AI: [Tries another wrong approach]
You: "Ugh, forget it"
Done in 30,000 tokens (optimal would be 5,000).
```

**Why severely wasteful:**
- Completely vague request
- Many clarification rounds
- AI guessed wrong multiple times
- Didn't complete successfully
- 17% efficient (5000/30000)

**Your feedback:** "Efficiency: Severely wasteful - extremely vague requirements, 15+ clarification rounds. Mandatory training required."

**What happens:**
- Mandatory training on Human-AI Interaction Guide
- Pre-approval required for AI usage for 30 days
- One-on-one coaching with AI Governance Team
- Weekly efficiency check-ins
- Manager notified

---

### How Efficiency is Calculated

```
Efficiency % = (Optimal Tokens / Actual Tokens) × 100

Optimal Tokens = Estimated tokens if:
  - You provided exact file paths
  - Requirements were complete upfront
  - AI executed in single pass
  - No rework needed

Actual Tokens = What was actually used
```

**Example:**
- Task: "Update config timeout"
- Optimal: 5,000 tokens (with clear requirements)
- Actual: 15,000 tokens (vague requirements, clarifications, rework)
- Efficiency: 5000 / 15000 × 100 = 33% (Inefficient)
- Waste: 10,000 tokens ($0.03 wasted)

---

### Adjusted Thresholds by Workflow Type

Not all work is the same. Efficiency targets adjust based on workflow:

| Workflow Type | Description | Optimal Target | Why Different |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Waterfall** | All requirements known upfront | ≥80% | No excuse for inefficiency |
| **Iterative** | Legitimate refinement loops | ≥65% | Expected iteration |
| **Exploratory** | Discovery/research work | ≥60% | Learning as you go |
| **Emergency** | Production incident, context switch | ≥50% | Context switching penalty |

**Example - Exploratory work:**
```
You: "Help me understand how authentication works in this codebase"
AI: [Explores]
You: "Focus on OAuth"
AI: [Dives deeper]
You: "Show me token validation"
AI: [Analyzes]

Result: 62% efficiency
Rating: OPTIMAL (because 62% > 60% target for exploratory)
```

**Note:** AI agents mark workflow type automatically or you can specify.

---

### Adjusted Thresholds by Experience Level

New users get adjusted targets:

| Experience | Time with AI | Optimal Target | Grace Period |
|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **New** | <30 days | ≥70% | First 10 sessions excluded |
| **Intermediate** | 30-90 days | ≥75% | None |
| **Experienced** | >90 days | ≥80% | None |

**Why:** You can't be expected to know all the patterns on day 1. System gives you time to learn.

---

### When AI Agent Fails (Not Your Fault)

Sometimes inefficiency is AI's fault:

**Scenario:**
```
You: "Update /home/user/project/README.md to version 2.0" (CLEAR)
AI: [Reads wrong file]
You: "No, README.md in the project root"
AI: [Reads correct file]
→ Wasted tokens due to AI failure
```

**System handles this:**
- AI marks: `ai_agent_failure: true`
- You get efficiency credit
- Marked as "AI failure - no penalty"
- AI Governance Team reviews AI agent

**You see:** "Session inefficiency due to AI agent error, not attributed to you"

---

### How to Improve Your Score

#### From Severely Wasteful → Inefficient

**Do:**
1. Provide file paths (use `ls` or file explorer to find them)
2. Describe what you want changed (not just "fix it")
3. Answer clarifying questions completely

**Example improvement:**
- Before: "Fix the config" → 20,000 tokens (25% efficient)
- After: "Update config/app.yml timeout to 30" → 8,000 tokens (62% efficient)

---

#### From Inefficient → Acceptable

**Do:**
1. Specify exact file paths (`/full/path/to/file`)
2. List all changes in one message
3. Clarify scope before AI starts

**Example improvement:**
- Before: "Update timeout" → 8,000 tokens (62% efficient)
- After: "Update /home/user/project/config/app.yml line 45: change timeout: 10 to timeout: 30" → 5,500 tokens (75% efficient)

---

#### From Acceptable → Optimal

**Do:**
1. Batch multiple changes together
2. Provide context (why you're making change)
3. Anticipate AI's questions and answer them upfront

**Example improvement:**
- Before: "Update /config/app.yml timeout to 30" → 5,500 tokens (75% efficient)
- After: "Update /home/user/project/config/app.yml line 45: change connection_timeout from 10 to 30 seconds. This fixes timeout issues reported in ticket #1234. Also update comment on line 44 to reflect new value." → 5,000 tokens (85% efficient)

---

### Common Misconceptions

#### Misconception 1: "High tokens = bad"

**Wrong:** High token usage isn't bad if efficiency is high.

**Examples:**
- 100,000 tokens at 90% efficiency = OPTIMAL (complex task done right)
- 10,000 tokens at 30% efficiency = SEVERELY WASTEFUL (simple task done wrong)

**What matters:** Efficiency %, not absolute token count.

---

#### Misconception 2: "AI asks questions = I did something wrong"

**Wrong:** AI asking clarifying questions is GOOD if your requirements were vague.

**Right approach:**
- AI asks: "Which config file?" → Answer quickly
- Next time: Provide file path upfront

**It's a learning process.**

---

#### Misconception 3: "Optimal = perfect"

**Wrong:** Optimal means ≥80% efficient, not 100%.

**Reality:**
- 85% efficiency = Excellent
- 95% efficiency = Outstanding
- 100% efficiency = Rare (means zero waste)

**Target is 80%+, not perfection.**

---

### What Your Efficiency Report Looks Like

After sessions >20,000 tokens, you'll see:

```
Task: Fork and customize internal repository
Tokens used: 25,313
Efficiency: 39% (Severely Wasteful)
Files changed: 5

Root cause: Vague requirements
- Initial request: "Update governance files" (no paths specified)
- 3 yes/no clarification rounds
- Wrong path attempted first

Recommendations:
1. Provide exact file paths: /home/user/project/file.txt
2. List all 5 file changes in one message instead of iteratively
3. Review token_optimization.md section "Demand Complete Requirements"

Optimal would have been: ~10,000 tokens
Your waste: 15,313 tokens ($0.046)
```

**How to read this:**
- **Efficiency score:** Where you stand
- **Root cause:** What went wrong
- **Recommendations:** How to improve
- **Waste:** What it cost

---

### Tracking Your Progress

You'll receive monthly efficiency reports showing:
- Average efficiency across all sessions
- Trend (improving/declining/stable)
- Comparison to team average
- Specific areas to improve

**Example monthly report:**

```
October 2025 Efficiency Report

Your Stats:
- Sessions: 12
- Average Efficiency: 68% (Acceptable)
- Trend: ↑ Improving (+15% from last month)
- Rank: 8/25 (team)

Breakdown:
- Optimal: 3 sessions
- Acceptable: 6 sessions
- Inefficient: 3 sessions
- Severely Wasteful: 0 sessions

Top improvement: File paths! You now provide exact paths 80% of the time.

Next focus: Batch questions - you still do yes/no loops. Try asking all questions in one message.
```

---

### Quick Reference Card

**Print and keep at your desk:**

| If AI says... | It means... | Do this... |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| "Efficiency: Optimal" | You did great! | Keep it up |
| "Efficiency: Acceptable" | Minor issues | Review guidelines (optional) |
| "Efficiency: Inefficient" | Significant waste | Training recommended |
| "Efficiency: Severely Wasteful" | Major problems | Mandatory training |

**Golden rules:**
1. Exact file paths (not "the config file")
2. Complete requirements upfront (not iterative)
3. Answer all questions in one message (not yes/no loops)

---

## AI Agent Limitations

### What AI Agents Cannot Do

1. **Remember Previous Conversations**
   - **Limitation:** AI agents have no memory across sessions
   - **Impact:** Cannot recall what was discussed yesterday, last week, or earlier in a different session
   - **Mitigation:** Document important decisions in files (README, CHANGES.md, session notes)

2. **Access Information Outside Current Context**
   - **Limitation:** AI agents only know what's in their current prompt and files they read
   - **Impact:** Cannot reference work from "last time" unless it's documented
   - **Mitigation:** Point agents to specific files or commit hashes

3. **Track Changes Across Sessions**
   - **Limitation:** No automatic tracking of what changed between sessions
   - **Impact:** May suggest already-completed work or redo previous decisions
   - **Mitigation:** Use git history, CHANGES.md, or TODO files

4. **Understand Implicit Context**
   - **Limitation:** Cannot infer your mental model or project history
   - **Impact:** May ask "obvious" questions or make wrong assumptions
   - **Mitigation:** Provide explicit context upfront

5. **Preserve State Without Documentation**
   - **Limitation:** Anything not committed to files is lost
   - **Impact:** Incomplete work disappears when session ends
   - **Mitigation:** Require agents to commit work and document next steps

---

## Human Responsibilities

### 1. Provide Complete Requirements

**Bad Pattern:**
```
Human: "Update the governance files"
AI: "Which files? What changes?"
Human: "The internal ones"
AI: "Which directory? What updates?"
Human: "You know, the fork changes"
[3-4 rounds of clarification, 10,000+ tokens wasted]
```

**Good Pattern:**
```
Human: "Update /path/to/ai-agent-governance-framework/README.md
        - Change title to 'Internal v2.1'
        - Update clone URL to -internal repo
        - Change support links to internal channels"
AI: [Reads once, edits once, done in ~5,000 tokens]
```

### 2. Specify Exact Paths

**AI agents cannot guess:**
- Which directory you're referring to
- Which file among multiple similar ones
- Whether you mean a local file or remote repo

**Always provide:**
- Absolute paths: `/home/user/projects/myproject/file.txt`
- Or clear relative paths: `./docs/README.md` (when working directory is known)

### 3. Clarify Scope Upfront

**Questions to answer before starting:**
- Which files need changes?
- What's the desired outcome?
- Are there files that should NOT be touched?
- Is this for testing or production?
- Should changes be committed immediately?

### 4. Accept That Questions Save Money

**Token costs:**
- Vague request → clarification loop: 25,000+ tokens ($0.075)
- Clear request → single execution: 8,000 tokens ($0.024)
- **Savings: 68% reduction**

**Better to spend 2 minutes clarifying than waste tokens on guesswork.**

### 5. Document Work for Future Sessions

**End-of-session checklist:**
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Incomplete work documented in TODO or CHANGES.md
- [ ] Next steps clearly stated
- [ ] Important context captured in README or notes

**Pattern:**
```bash
# Before ending session
git add .
git commit -m "Implement X, Y complete, Z pending"

echo "## Next Session
- Complete feature Z (see TODO in code)
- Test integration with system A
- Update docs for new workflow
" > SESSION-NOTES.md

git add SESSION-NOTES.md
git commit -m "Document next steps"
```

---

## AI Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Demand Clarity Before Starting

**AI agents must:**
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are vague
- Request exact file paths when locations are unclear
- Confirm scope before executing destructive operations
- Refuse to proceed with ambiguous instructions

**Pattern:**
```
Human: "Update the config files"
AI: "I need more information:
     1. Which config files? (provide paths)
     2. What changes should be made?
     3. Is this for dev, staging, or prod?"
[Wait for complete answer before proceeding]
```

### 2. Optimize for Single-Pass Execution

**Efficient pattern:**
1. Get complete requirements
2. Read all necessary files once
3. Make all changes
4. Commit and document
5. Done

**Avoid:**
- Reading same file multiple times
- Trial-and-error approaches
- Multiple clarification rounds mid-task

### 3. Document Before Session Ends

**AI agents must:**
- Commit all changes with clear messages
- Create/update tracking files for incomplete work
- Document decisions and rationale
- Leave clear next steps for future sessions

### 4. Report Token Usage

**For significant tasks, report:**
```
Task: [description]
Tokens used: [number]
Files changed: [count]
Efficiency: [optimal/suboptimal + reason]
```

### 5. Educate Humans on Patterns

**When inefficiency occurs:**
- Explain what caused token waste
- Show optimal interaction pattern
- Update this guide if new pattern emerges

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: File Modification

**Human provides:**
- Exact file path
- Specific changes required
- Any constraints or requirements

**AI agent:**
1. Reads file once
2. Makes changes
3. Shows diff for confirmation
4. Commits if approved

**Token budget:** 5,000-8,000

---

### Pattern 2: Multi-File Update

**Human provides:**
- List of files with paths
- Consistent change pattern OR specific changes per file
- Desired commit message

**AI agent:**
1. Reads all files in parallel
2. Makes changes in parallel
3. Shows summary of changes
4. Commits all together

**Token budget:** 15,000-20,000 (5 files)

---

### Pattern 3: Code Search and Analysis

**Human provides:**
- What to search for (specific function, pattern, concept)
- Why (context for analysis)
- Expected output format

**AI agent:**
1. Uses appropriate search tools (glob, grep)
2. Analyzes findings
3. Presents summary with file:line references
4. Recommends next steps

**Token budget:** 10,000-15,000

---

### Pattern 4: Forking/Customization Project

**Human provides:**
- Source repo URL or path
- Target repo name
- List of customizations needed
- Upstream relationship (maintain or detach)

**AI agent:**
1. Creates fork/new repo
2. Configures remotes
3. Applies customizations in batch
4. Documents differences in INTERNAL-FORK-CHANGES.md
5. Commits with clear lineage

**Token budget:** 30,000-40,000

**Common failure mode:**
- Human says "fork this and customize"
- AI doesn't ask which customizations
- AI makes some changes
- Human says "not those, these other ones"
- Re-work wastes 15,000+ tokens

**Fix:** Human lists ALL customizations upfront.

---

## Session Continuity Strategies

### Problem: AI Forgets Previous Session

**Real example:**
```
Session 1: AI helps set up fork, makes internal changes
Session 2: New AI agent has no memory of Session 1
Human: "Where did you put the internal fork?"
AI: "I don't have that information"
[Human frustrated, tokens wasted explaining]
```

### Solution: Persistent State Files

**Create tracking files:**

**1. SESSION-NOTES.md** (temporary, per session)
```markdown
## Current Session: 2025-10-23

### Completed
- Created fork: ai-agent-governance-framework-internal
- Customized 5 files for internal use
- Committed changes (commit: abc123)

### Incomplete
- Public repo still has internal changes (needs revert)
- Need to identify commit before internal changes

### Next Steps
1. Find commit hash before internal changes in public repo
2. Revert public repo to that commit
3. Push clean version to upstream
```

**2. CHANGES.md** (permanent, cumulative)
```markdown
# Change Log

## 2025-10-23 - Internal Fork Customization
- Created private fork: JohnYoungSuh/ai-agent-governance-framework-internal
- Customized README, CONTRIBUTING, Helm charts, terraform outputs
- Commit: ec26bb2

## 2025-10-22 - Added Tit-for-Tat Game Theory
- Implemented reputation system
- Commit: 1cd3332
```

**3. TODO.md** (actionable items)
```markdown
# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Revert public repo to pre-internal-changes state
- [ ] Document token optimization patterns in framework

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add CI/CD tests for guardrail validation
- [ ] Create example internal deployment

## Low Priority
- [ ] Improve documentation formatting
```

### Usage by New AI Agent

**When starting new session:**
```
Human: "Continue work on the governance framework fork"

AI: [Reads SESSION-NOTES.md, CHANGES.md, TODO.md]
    "I see from SESSION-NOTES.md that:
     - Fork created: ai-agent-governance-framework-internal (commit: ec26bb2)
     - Incomplete: Public repo needs internal changes reverted

     From TODO.md, high priority is reverting public repo.

     Should I proceed with finding the commit before internal changes?"
```

**Result:** Seamless continuation, no context loss.

---

## Token Efficiency Reference

| Interaction Type | Optimal Tokens | Waste Indicators |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Single file edit | 5,000 | >10,000 = multiple reads or unclear requirements |
| Multi-file update (5 files) | 15,000 | >25,000 = rework or clarification loops |
| Code search | 10,000 | >20,000 = inefficient search strategy |
| Yes/No question loop (avoid) | 2,000 per round | Each round is waste - batch questions |
| Forking project | 30,000 | >50,000 = missing requirements caused rework |

**Target: Stay within optimal range 80% of the time.**

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Iterative Guessing

**What happens:**
```
Human: "Fix the build"
AI: [Tries approach A] "Is it this issue?"
Human: "No"
AI: [Tries approach B] "How about this?"
Human: "No"
AI: [Tries approach C] "This one?"
Human: "No, it's the config file"
```

**Cost:** 20,000+ tokens

**Fix:**
```
Human: "Fix the build - error in logs shows missing env var in config.yml"
AI: [Reads config.yml, fixes env var, done]
```

**Cost:** 5,000 tokens

### Anti-Pattern 2: Assumption Cascade

**What happens:**
```
AI: [Assumes user wants approach X]
AI: [Implements X]
Human: "I wanted Y not X"
AI: [Reverts X, implements Y]
Human: "Also need Z"
AI: [Adds Z to Y]
```

**Cost:** 25,000+ tokens

**Fix:**
```
AI: "There are approaches X, Y, Z. Which do you prefer?"
Human: "Y and Z"
AI: [Implements Y and Z together]
```

**Cost:** 10,000 tokens

### Anti-Pattern 3: No End-of-Session Documentation

**What happens:**
```
Session 1: Work 80% complete
[Session ends, nothing documented]
Session 2: New AI has no context
Human explains everything again
AI starts from scratch or makes wrong assumptions
```

**Cost:** Duplicate work, human frustration, 30,000+ wasted tokens

**Fix:**
```
Session 1: At 80% complete
AI: "Before session ends, I'll commit current state and document next steps"
[Creates SESSION-NOTES.md with current state and TODOs]
Session 2: New AI reads notes, continues seamlessly
```

**Cost:** 5,000 tokens for documentation, saves 30,000+ in Session 2

---

## Escalation Protocol

### When AI Agent Should Stop and Ask

**Situations requiring human clarification:**
1. **Ambiguous scope** - "Update config" but 5 config files exist
2. **Multiple valid approaches** - Both A and B work, each has tradeoffs
3. **Destructive operation** - Action is irreversible
4. **High token cost** - Task will exceed 50,000 tokens
5. **Security/compliance risk** - Action might violate policy
6. **Inconsistent instructions** - Human request conflicts with previous guidance

**Pattern:**
```
AI: "⚠️ Clarification needed before proceeding:

     Issue: [describe ambiguity]
     Options: [list valid choices]
     Recommendation: [AI's suggestion with rationale]

     Please specify which approach to take."

[STOP and wait for human response]
```

### When Human Should Stop and Clarify

**Indicators you need to provide more detail:**
- AI asks 2+ clarifying questions
- AI shows you multiple options to choose from
- AI says "I need more information"
- Task involves >10 files or complex workflow

**Action:** Take 2 minutes to write complete requirements.

# Slack Integration for Multi-Agent Workflows

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
**Purpose:** Track discussions, decisions, and reasoning across multi-agent development stages

---

## Overview

Integrate Slack with the PAR-PROTO multi-agent workflow to provide:
- **Discussion Tracking**: Capture all decisions and reasoning
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Async communication between stakeholders
- **Context Preservation**: Thread-based discussions per stage
- **Notification System**: Stage transitions and quality gate alerts
- **Audit Trail**: Searchable history of all project communications

---

## Channel Structure

### Dedicated Project Channels

Create dedicated channels for multi-agent projects:

```yaml
channel_naming_convention:
  format: "#proj-{project-key}-{short-name}"
  examples:
    - "#proj-map123-asset-framework"
    - "#proj-map456-payment-module"
    - "#proj-map789-user-auth"

channel_purpose:
  template: |
    🤖 Multi-Agent Project: {Project Name}

    **Jira:** {Jira URL}
    **Pattern:** {Two-Agent / Three-Agent}
    **Tier:** {1-4}
    **Stage:** {Current Stage}

    **Stages:**
    • Stage 1 (Copilot): {Status}
    • Stage 2 (Claude): {Status}
    • Stage 3 (Gemini): {Status}

    📌 Pin important decisions and approvals
    🧵 Use threads for focused discussions
```

### Channel Organization

```yaml
channel_types:
  # Main project channels
  project_channels:
    naming: "#proj-{key}-{name}"
    purpose: "All discussions for a specific project"
    members:
      - "Project team"
      - "Stakeholders"
      - "Quality gate approvers"

  # General channels
  general_channels:
    - name: "#ai-agent-governance"
      purpose: "Framework discussions and best practices"

    - name: "#quality-gates"
      purpose: "Cross-project quality gate discussions"

    - name: "#agent-performance"
      purpose: "Agent cost, performance, and optimization"

  # Automated notification channels
  notification_channels:
    - name: "#agent-alerts"
      purpose: "Automated notifications (budget, errors, completions)"

    - name: "#deployment-approvals"
      purpose: "Production deployment requests"
```

## Decision Tracking

### Decision Log Format

Use consistent format for capturing decisions:

```yaml
decision_template:
  emoji: "🎯"
  format: |
    🎯 **DECISION: {Decision Title}**

    **Context:**
    {Why this decision was needed}

    **Options Considered:**
    1. {Option 1} - {Pros/Cons}
    2. {Option 2} - {Pros/Cons}
    3. {Option 3} - {Pros/Cons}

    **Decision:**
    ✅ {Chosen option}

    **Reasoning:**
    {Why this option was chosen}

    **Impact:**
    {Who/what is affected}

    **Reversibility:**
    {Can this be changed later? How easily?}

    **Decided by:** @{decision_maker}
    **Date:** {date}
    **Jira:** {related_jira_issue}

  example: |
    🎯 **DECISION: Use PostgreSQL for Asset Lookup Storage**

    **Context:**
    Need to choose database for storing asset lookup data. Options include CSV files, KV store, or relational DB.

    **Options Considered:**
    1. CSV files - Simple but no query capabilities
    2. Splunk KV store - Integrated but limited scale
    3. PostgreSQL - Powerful but adds complexity

    **Decision:**
    ✅ Use Splunk KV store with CSV export option

    **Reasoning:**
    • Keeps everything within Splunk ecosystem
    • Adequate performance for <1M assets
    • CSV export provides backup/portability
    • Can migrate to PostgreSQL if scale exceeds limits

    **Impact:**
    • Development: Simpler integration
    • Operations: No new infrastructure needed
    • Performance: Meets SLAs for expected scale

    **Reversibility:**
    Medium - Can export to CSV and migrate to PostgreSQL if needed. Would require 1-2 days effort.

    **Decided by:** @techlead
    **Date:** 2025-10-14
    **Jira:** MAP-123

    **Constraints:**
    {Technical or business limitations}

    **Next Steps:**

    **Impact:** {Low / Medium / High}
    **Risk Score:** {Likelihood × Impact}

    **Potential Consequences:**
    {What happens if this risk materializes}

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't have important discussions in DMs**
   - Loses transparency
   - No audit trail

2. **Don't skip documenting decisions**
   - Future confusion
   - Lost reasoning

3. **Don't ignore @mentions in quality gates**

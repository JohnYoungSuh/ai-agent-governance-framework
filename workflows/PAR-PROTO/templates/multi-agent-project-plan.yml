# PROBLEM DEFINITION
# =============================================================================

problem:
  title: "[Brief problem description]"

  description: |
    [Detailed explanation of the problem:
    - What is wrong or needs improvement
    - Why it matters (business/technical impact)
    - Current state vs. desired state]

  complexity_assessment:
    code_complexity: [low, medium, high]
    documentation_needs: [low, medium, high]
    stakeholder_count: [number]
    production_critical: [yes, no]

  success_criteria:
    - "[Measurable outcome 1]"
    - "[Measurable outcome 2]"
    - "[Measurable outcome 3]"

  constraints:
    budget: "$XXX.XX"
    timeline: "[Y days/weeks]"
    dependencies:
      - "[Dependency 1]"
      - "[Dependency 2]"

  decision:
    pattern: "multi-agent"  # Decided to use multi-agent approach
    rationale: |
      [Why multi-agent pattern was chosen:
      - Complexity requires multiple phases
      - Different skills needed at different stages
      - Cost optimization opportunity
      - Quality gates are critical]

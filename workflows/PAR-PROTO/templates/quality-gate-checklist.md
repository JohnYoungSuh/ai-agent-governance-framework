## Decision Matrix

| Gate | Status | Blocker Issues | Decision | Approver | Date |
|------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|------|
| Gate 1 (Prototype → Production) | [ ] Pass [ ] Fail | [List blockers] | [ ] Proceed [ ] Revise | [Name] | [Date] |
| Gate 2 (Production Readiness) | [ ] Pass [ ] Fail | [List blockers] | [ ] Deploy [ ] Revise | [Name] | [Date] |

## Blocker Resolution

If quality gate fails, document blockers and resolution plan:

```yaml
blocker_1:
  description: "Description of blocking issue"
  severity: [critical, high, medium, low]
  assigned_to: "Name"
  resolution_plan: "Steps to resolve"
  estimated_time: "Time to fix"
  due_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
```
